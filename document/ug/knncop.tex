Given a new point without label for KNN algorithm application, first set control to "0001" to reset then to "0001" to standby. Next the coordinates of the point must be given as well as the coordinates for every dataset point and it's label (for every dataset point the distance must be computed by setting control to "0010" and then to "0000"). Once all the distance were computed the KNN core is ready to classify the point and that is done by setting control to "0100" and lastly to "'0000". The label of the studied point can be read from the respective register.
